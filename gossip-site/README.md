Run

    rails server

## Database

The database includes 50 users and gossips, and 8 cities. <br>
Each user has an email and password to log in, such as

    #user10_email  user10@gossip.com #user10_password "password"
    #user11_email  user11@gossip.com #user11_password "password"
    #user12_email  user12@gossip.com #user12_password "password"
    #and so on
    
You can as well create your own user, with Sign Up.
